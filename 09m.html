        <p>The above graph show the price evolution of Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund since its inception. Over the years, it did just as good as the market: which is not bad. With the launch of this fund in 1976, it was dubbed "un-American". Why stay the course, if you can be a winner by beating the market? Because most people can't, especially not in the long term. Today, index-based investing appears to be one of the best financial inventions of the previous century. </p>

            <h3>Bolge</h3>
            <p>The key figure behind this is John Bogle. Bogle created index-fund provider Vanguard, passed away this year. He brought the upside of capitalism to the normal people, in a famously uncapitalist manner. Throughout his life he was a advocate for indexing and democratizing capital markets. But in his last writings, he is raising a warning for the unintended negative externalities caused by the success of indexing. </p>
