    <h3>An analysis of proxy voting by the largest passive fund managers</h3>

        <p>"The Stock Market is Having its Best Start in 21 Years," reported Sounds great. But what does it mean?</p>
        <p>Not much for most people - unless this is reflecting an upward trend in the long run. Most people are not really affected by daily market fluctuations. Not only because they have a relatively very small stake in the stock market , but also because an increasing amount of people invests through passive funds that thrive with long-term growth, rather than short-lasting spikes.</p>

                <p>The relationship that people have with the stock market has drastically changed over the last decades. In the past, retail investors – or “normal” individuals – owned a majority of the shares in companies that were publicly listed. People directly held shares of companies like Ford or General Electric. Changes in the value of those companies had a direct impact on the assets of the retail investors holding those companies in their portfolio.</p>
                <p> Today, more than 100 million individuals, accounting for nearly 45% of the American households, own open-end funds. In 2018, active funds witnessed the highest annual recorded outflow according to ICI data. And while market volatility in the end of 2018 should have created opportunities for active managers, the proportion of active funds did not increase and passive flows did not decline.</p>

                <div class="title">Why passive investing works</div>
                <p>Passive investing works because of the low costs to investors to mitigate investment risks through cheap diversification, whereby the potential returns are not that much compromised.  </p>
                <p>Index investing allowed millions of households to benefit from lost-cost diversified equity investments. It democratized investing for normal people. However, while innovations can be successful in solving existing problems, new problems are created along the way. </p>

                <div class="title">Active shareholders</div>
                <p> While passive investing surged, active shareholders such as hedge funds have been more active in using their shareholder rights at shareholder meetings.</p>

                <div class="title">Most of the passive money is managed by a few</div>
                <p> The rise of passive index funds led to a concentration of corporate ownership. The three largest U.S. asset managers combined are the largest shareholder in about 88% of the S&P 500 companies.</p>
