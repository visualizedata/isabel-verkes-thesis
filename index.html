        <p>The above graph shows the price evolution of Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund since its inception. Over the years, it did just as good as the market: which is not bad. But right after the launch of this index fund in 1976 it was dubbed "un-American" or a "folly". The fund initially struggled for attention (and dollars).
            Why stay the course, if you can be a winner by beating the market? Because most people can't, especially not in the long term. Today, index-based investing appears to be one of the most successful financial inventions of the previous century. </p>

    <h3 id="title_Section-JBogle">John Bolge</h3>
    <div class="section-JBogle">
        <p>The key figure behind this is John Bogle, who passed away earlier this year. Bogle created indexing as we know as the founder of Vanguard, today's the worlds largest mutual fund-provider. He brought the upside of capitalism to the normal people, in a famously uncapitalist manner. Throughout his life he was a advocate for indexing and democratizing capital markets. But in his last writings, he is raising a warning for the unintended negative externalities caused by the success of indexing. </p>

            <p>Indexing in Bogle's terms: “Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!” </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>The rise of passive investment</h3>
            <p> More and more people followed Bogle's vision.  By indexing people can spread their risks and returns across a diversified pool of companies, at relatively low costs with low entrance barriers. Instead of picking individual stocks, more investors have been joining index-based funds. Index-investing is boring but powerful; it lets the market do its work for you.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Low cost, higher net returns</h3>
            Bogle saw early that succesful investing is not only about the potential gains, as a result from outsmarting the average investor. Instead, he focused on minimizing the inevitable loss: the costs implied by investing. The <span style = "color:#ec7d26" > expense ratios for index-based </span> investing are so low that on a net basis, it may beat the more costly active investment strategies.

        <div> <p>Often when an innovative solution takes away certain issues, new ones are created. In his last writings, Bogle warns for the negative implications that unbridled growth of indexing might have on the governance of corporate America. Index investors are ultimately passive. They let funds vote on their behalf. The inflow into index funds likely continues to increase more than other investments.</p></div>
        <div> <p>As a result, a few institutional investors will have voting control of virtually every large US corporation. The concentration of assets under management translates into concentrated voting power at shareholder meetings. Today about 35% of the total US stock ownership is index-based. What if this passes the tipping point of 50%?</p></div>
