                <p>This graph shows the price evolution of Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund since its inception. Over the last years, millions of Americans bought funds inspired by this one. <br>It was not always like that. The fund initially struggled for recognition and dollars. Right after its launch in 1976 this passive fund was dubbed "un-American" and "Bogle's folly". <br> Today, index-based investing is one of the most successful financial inventions of the previous century. It became so normal that it changed the fabric of financial markets.</p>

        <p><span style= "font-size: xx-large; font-family: 'Arvo', serif" >T</span>he key figure behind this development is John Bogle, who passed away earlier this year. Bogle brought indexing to the mass as the founder of Vanguard, currently the worlds largest mutual fund-provider. Bogle brought some of the upside of capitalism to normal people, in a famously uncapitalist manner.<br> <br>
            Throughout his life Bogle advocated for financial inclusion by giving retail investors better and smarter options to participate in capital markets. For him, index-based investing was crucial to this larger objective. But in his last writings, he is raising a warning for the unintended negative externalities caused by the success of indexing. Why? This visual article takes a look. </p>

            <p>Index funds are portfolios based on market indexes (like the S&P 500) instead of individual stock selection, meaning lower management costs. "That is lazy. Why not pick the right stocks and beat the market?"</p>
        </div>
        <div><p>Because most people can't, especially not in the long term. Actively looking at investment opportunities is not for everybody, and hiring someone to pick a good set of diversified stocks is costly. That is what Bogle saw like no other. </p>

            <h3 class="graph-section-titles">The rise of passive investment</h3>
            <p> By pooling their money in an index fund, investors can spread their risks across a diversified pool of companies. The result is little effort, less risk, reasonable returns at lower costs.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p> As this concept proved itself over time, more and more people are buying index-based investments such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). <br> <br> The share of index-based investing has more than doubled during the past 10 years, accounting now for a 35%. This trend is likely to continue.</p> <p>What if this passes the tipping point of 50%?</p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3 class="graph-section-titles">Low costs,  higher net returns</h3>
            Bogle saw early that succesful investing is not only about the potential gains, as a result from outsmarting the average investor. <br><br> Instead, he focused on minimizing the inevitable loss: the costs implied by investing. The <span style = "color:#ec7d26" > expense ratios for index-based </span> investing are so low that on a net basis, it may beat the more costly active investment strategies.

    <div class="concentration-graph">
        <img src="Data/img/concentration_2.svg">
        <div> <p>The innovations that solve existing problems can create new ones. <br> <br> In his last writings, Bogle warns for the negative implications that unbridled growth of indexing might have on the governance of corporate America.
            <br><br>Index investors are ultimately passive. They let funds vote on their behalf.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="under-concentration"> <p>As a result, the same few asset management companies who are the largest index fund providers in terms of assets under management, are increasingly the ones with the decisive votes at shareholder meetings. The concentration of assets under management translates into concentrated shareholder control.
    <br> And in contrast to active investors, index funds follow the index and won't buy or sell based (expected) stock performance. For as long as a company is in the index tracked by a fund, these few asset managers are eternal shareholders, representing increasingly large stakes in virtually every big company. That long-term investment horizon makes uniquely well-suited as promoters of sustainability within the corporate world.<br> <br> However, index funds are passive investment strategies, explicitly not analyzing companies to assess their stock. The ongoing engagement between shareholders and management helps companies: some healthy dose of shareholder scrutiny keeps companies' management sharp. This is where Bogle is concerned: when passive money owns such a large part of the corporate world, will it result in passive shareholders that let management do what they want?</p>

            <p>Passive investment is rising, but other investors are more activist than in earlier years.</p>
            <p> Among these proposals, there has been an impressive rise in environmental proposals in the past years. Proposals related to addressing climate change risks, the largest sub-topic in this category, were supported by a record median level of 32.8% last year. That is more than in previous years, but still not that much. And that is the area where the ultimate long-term investors, index funds, can make a difference.</p>
